## <a name="inst"></a>Installation steps

1. Clone the release branch of the BookStack GitHub repository into a folder.

~~~bash
    git clone https://github.com/sgilz/babalao.git
~~~

2. cd into the application folder and run:

    ~~~bash
    composer install
    ~~~


3. Also install npm dependencies

    ~~~bash
    npm install
    ~~~

    if you prefer yarn, run:

    ~~~bash
    yarn
    ~~~

4. Set up a .env file, you'll need to have a mysql database.

    You can copy [.env.example](https://github.com/laravel/laravel/blob/master/.env.example) from laravel repository

    And replace it with your information

5. In the application root, generate a unique application key, by running:

    ~~~bash
    php artisan key:generate 
    ~~~

6. Install the next library already downloaded for invoices management.

    ~~~bash
    php artisan invoices:install
    ~~~
    Since it is evolving fast you might want to have latest template after update using Artisan command:

    ~~~bash
    php artisan invoices:update
    ~~~
    **Notice**: It will give a warning if you really want to override default resources

7. Run migrations

    ~~~bash
    php artisan migrate
    ~~~

8. Generate seeds

    ~~~bash
    php artisan db:seed
    ~~~

9. Now we need to generate the storage symlink, if you have problems with the existing one, delete:


    babalao/public/storage

    And run 

    ~~~bash
    php artisan storage:link
    ~~~

10. We are almost ready, al you need to do now is run:

    ~~~bash
    php artisan serve
    ~~~
